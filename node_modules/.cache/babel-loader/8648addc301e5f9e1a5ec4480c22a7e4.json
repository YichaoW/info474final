Here comes the magic behind various computer operations and data arrangement--sorting algorithms. Since sorting is a very common operation that we want to perform on a collection of data in various real-world use cases and many other advanced algorithms are based on sorting including binary search, people have come up with assorted ways rearrange a given array or list elements according to a certain order. Different algorithms have different logic and, therefore, different characteristics and efficiency. Through the interactive explorable explanation, you are going to master various sorting algorithm mechanisms and how to apply them to real world situations.\"));\n  }\n\n}","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/Leon/Desktop/info474final/src/Components/Intro.js"],"names":["React","Component","Intro","constructor","props","state","componentDidMount","render"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAgBC,SAAhB,QAAiC,OAAjC;AAEA,OAAO,MAAMC,KAAN,SAAoBD,SAApB,CAA8B;AACjCE,EAAAA,WAAW,CAACC,KAAD,EAAQ;AACf,UAAMA,KAAN;AAEA,SAAKC,KAAL,GAAa,EAAb;AAGH;;AAIDC,EAAAA,iBAAiB,GAAG,CAEnB;;AAGDC,EAAAA,MAAM,GAAG;AACL,WACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,OACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,s7BAFJ,CADJ;AAiBH;;AAlCgC","sourcesContent":["import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nexport class Intro extends Component {\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props)\n\n        this.state = {\n\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n    componentDidMount() {\n\n    }\n\n\n    render() {\n        return(\n            <div>\n                <h1>Introduction</h1>\n                <p>\n                As we live in the tech-driven world and interact with computer software on a daily basis, \n                have you ever wondered how we can a computer show a list of students’ names in alphabetical order \n                or rank them by credits earned either ascendingly or desendingly under the hood? \n                Here comes the magic behind various computer operations and data arrangement--sorting algorithms. \n                Since sorting is a very common operation that we want to perform on a collection of data in various real-world use cases \n                and many other advanced algorithms are based on sorting including binary search, \n                people have come up with assorted ways rearrange a given array or list elements according to a certain order. \n                Different algorithms have different logic and, therefore, different characteristics and efficiency. \n                Through the interactive explorable explanation, you are going to master various sorting algorithm mechanisms \n                and how to apply them to real world situations. \n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
